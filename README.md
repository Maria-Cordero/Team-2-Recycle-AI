## Overview
### Description
This application identifies which recyclable material an item is made of based on an image submitted by the user. The user also has the ability to find nearby recycling centers based on their current location.

### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** Utility or Lifestyle?
- **Mobile:**
- **Story:**
- **Market:**
- **Habit:** This app contains a reward system for the users. Users earn points everytime they take a picture of a new item to recycle and reach milestones. This gamified approach can make users prone to visiting the app more often.
- **Scope:** The app targets a demographic interested in recycling. We want to grow and maintain our user base by helping streamline the recycling process. Later, we would like to expand the application to have an interactive aspect through the marketplace where users can put up items that they will no longer use for somebody else to have.
